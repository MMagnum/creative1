  <p>
      As part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints each member is
      invited (expected) to give two years to the lord. This means leaving everything
      behind and going to to focus on service and bringing others closer to Christ.
      There are many reasons that I chose to serve a mission and I am glad that I 
      made the decision. I was excited to share my experience with the church 
      and how they had helped me grow and learn. A mission was much more than this
      to me given that I was called to go serve in another country leaving everything
      I had, meaning no phone, no computer, friends, family and the safety of my home.
      I saw an oppertunity to learn about not only how to help others but also 
      about independence and living on my own without others there to guide me
      every step of the way. There were many leadership oppertunities and it 
      taught me more than I could have ever imagined about time management and
      scheduling.
