     <p>
      My adventure in indonesia started when I arrived in Jarkarta, Indonesia
      in October of 2013. It was not like the state of Utah that I had moved from.
      This was the first time I had been out of the country and I have never been
      very far from Utah. As soon as i got off the plane the humidity hit me like
      a wall. This tropical island was nothing like I had ever experienced before.
      The first night we got some food and it was delicious. It was fried rice but
      unlike anything I had ever had before. It was full of flavor and perfectly
      cooked. The next morning we went to a stadium that had a track around it to 
      get some exercise and I never imagined that I had that much sweat in my body.
      By the time we returned home my clothes were drenched in sweat. We went out
      with those in Jakarta for a day to experience the city and watch some of 
      the more experienced missionaries. I have never seen a city as big as Jakarta.
      We rode buses around the city visiting a few people and places that they had
      planned for the day. The whole day was a blur. It was all so new I could barely
      wrap my mind around it. Exausted after being in the humidity all day I got some
      food and went to bed. Then the next day they put me on a bus headed to Bandung.

          I arrived in Bandung after a four hour bus ride and was picked up by
          those that I was going to be living with for some time. This was not 
          only a brand new city but also a brand new country and I was thrown
          right into the middle of it. We rode a couple public trasports to get
          my new home and then walked from the main street. I was amazed at how
          different this country was. There were no homes near us that had any 
          type of yard. The houses were connected to eachother sharing a wall 
          with each neighbor. Each house had high gates and walls with spikes or even 
          broken glass on top. They had attempted to teach us the native
          language of Indonesian for a couple months befor we headed out and I 
          thougth that I was getting a hang of it until I was actually there.
          Nothing could have prepared me for this language and the accent of 
          those that were native speakers. At first it sounded like we had been 
          learning the wrong language because I did not understand a word anybody
          said. I was living with an Indonesian missionary who spoke little english
          and two other americans that were only there for my first three weeks.
          Then it was just me and Elder Sumanungkalit. This was a very large city
          for there to only be the two of us as missionaries for our church. This 
          was the beggining of a very interesting six months in Bandung.

      <p>
          As I was struggling to learn the language I was still having a lot of 
          fun. There were so many new foods to try. Almost every meal was served with 
          rice. For breakfast there was a rice pourage that was very popular. 
          There were venders that would walk down the streets during different 
          times of day bringing by food that they would pull around on hand carts.
          In the morning there would be the rice pourage, a vegetable and fish 
          cart and my favorite, the bread cart!!! He had many different varieties
          of bread. some were just a white bread but there were some that were 
          white bread with different flavors inside sections of the bread. There
          was a chocolate filled bread, strawberry filled, and one that was filled
          with a sweet orange filling. At night they would be selling fried rice
          and fried noodles that they would cook right in front of your house.
          There were also different shops that would sell food during lunch near
          our home. They would have chicken, eggs, vegetables and other fried foods
          all cooked in different spices and methods. I know I am talking a lot 
          about the food but that's just becuase I enjoyed it this much! I was 
          passionate about trying new types of food and they would never dissapoint.
