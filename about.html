    <h1>About Marc and Indonesia</h1>

<div id="aboutpic">

  <p>
      Marc was raised in utah and grew up in a middle class neighborhood. 
      He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day saints. 
      When he was 18 years old he served a mission for the church where he
      spent two years teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ in Indonesia. 
      Now he is attending BYU and spends his days doing homework from
      morning until night with no rest or free time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Indonesia is most know for its tourist attractions like the Island of Bali,
    the many religious temples, and the zoo's. There are many things about 
    indonesia that people do not know.
  </p>
  
  <div id="rate" class="indor">
  <p>The value of one dollar in indonesia is {{indorate}} Rupia</p> <br>
  <p>This does not mean much when you do not know how much items cost in Indonesia,
  so to put it in perspective you can buy a cheap meal ranging from 6,000-15,000 Rupia.
  Meaning you can get a meal for about a dollar. Nicer meals cost anywhere from 20,000 
  to 100,000. The most expensive meal I got was in a 5 star hotel and was a buffet for 200,000 Rupia or just under 15 Dollars.
  These prices are for the main islands not including Bali.</p>
